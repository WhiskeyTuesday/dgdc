David Goldberg Director and Cinematographer website

This is the source code for a website I did some work on for a friend. He had someone else build it initially and I made a number of changes to it as you could look at in the history of this repository if you really wamted to. If you were to go back to the code as it was initially commited you'd find exactly what I started with, and therefor did not write myself. That work, as stands the initial commit, was written by someone else the name of whom I do not know and to whom I therefor cannot give credit or assign blame, as the case may be.

The javascript in particular I cannot take credit for, as all I have done is change the names of various variables and functions, as well as change some of the URLs pointed to. The structure of the code is not my work.
